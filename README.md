## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Mac**: Ctrl+Cmd+F - Toggle focused mode (hides interface elements and enters fullscreen)
- **Windows/Linux**: F11 - Toggle focused mode (hides interface elements and enters fullscreen)

The keyboard shortcuts are implemented via the View menu and are available globally.

## Behavior

The focused mode provides a distraction-free reading experience:
- Hides both the tab bar and annotation toolbar when activated
- Enters fullscreen mode for a truly immersive experience
- Hides the context pane to maximize reading space

## How it works

The plugin:
- Adds a menu item to the View menu
- Registers keyboard shortcuts for toggling focused mode
- Adds custom CSS for fullscreen mode
